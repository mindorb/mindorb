Start creating Mind Maps with just a few branches:

Add even more branches if you like:

A 3D Mind Mapping tool which makes it possible to represent Mind Maps in 3D. We have it to do with an own 3d language for creating, showing and learning Mind Maps. The main features are:

  - correct representation of the radiant visualization technology called "Mind Mapping"
  - Creation of nearly an unlimited amount of nodes
  - Zooming into and out of nodes
  - Dragging of nodes

# the idea

Considering the radiant Mind Mapping method, it would be the best idea to do everything the radiant way. There already is a 3D mode inside Mind Mapping software, but it still lacks real 3D.

Creating 3D Mind Maps could be difficult. However, with this method it will be easy.

The starting point is a simple sphere:

The next step is creating a "hull", something around of it:

On top of the hull, you can create new items.
